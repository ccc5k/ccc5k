# Project Title: Simulation-Based Model Creation in R

## Overview

This project creates a linear regression model in R to simulate the relationship between class start time and the grade achieved in the class.

## Features

- **Model Simulation**: Simulates the effect that class start time has upon the grade achieved in a given class based on input parameters.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Simulates interactions between agents or components.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphical outputs such as plots and charts to visualize results.
- **Parameter Adjustments**: Easily adjustable parameters to study their effects on the system.
- **Data Output**: Saves key simulation results for further analysis.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- R version 4.x or higher
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `data.table`, `Rcpp`, etc. (See `install_packages.R` for a full list)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulation-model-R.git
   cd simulation-model-R
